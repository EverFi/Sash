# Badge sizes

We have a few different sizes of the badge images automatically created now, 
need to update the views and json to reflect that change. 
* Getters for different sized badge images
* Update the badge show screen with all the image sizes
* Update JSON with all the sizes

# User Management View
Currently have 152538 Users, but not any insight into them or management
interface

* Index (paginated...)
* User show with a users badges & info
* User edit

# Analytics & data
Still working on what kind of stuff we want to track, but a good start would be
a dashboard that shows: 
* Dashboard of badges earned, like # earned today, this week, month, year, etc
* Tracked events on badges and users, sharing, viewing, etc, tracked via some
 new api calls
